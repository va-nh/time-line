								It was Turing-complete and able to solve "a large class of numerical problems" through reprogramming.
							</p>
							<p class="eniac__text text-size">
								ENIAC was designed by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert to calculate artillery firing tables 
								for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory (which later became a part of 
								the Army Research Laboratory). However, its first program was a study of the feasibility of 
								the thermonuclear weapon.

								The Alto is contained in a relatively small cabinet and uses a custom central processing unit

								of dollars despite its status as a personal computer. Only small numbers were built initially, 
								but by the late 1970s, about 1,000 were in use at various Xerox laboratories, and about another 
								500 in several universities. Total production was about 2,000 systems.

								the computer came from Wozniak's friend and Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. 
								The Apple I was Apple's first product, and to finance its creation, Wozniak sold his 
								HP-65 calculator for $500 and Jobs sold a second hand VW Microbus, for a few hundred dollars. 
								Wozniak demonstrated the first prototype in July 1976 at the Homebrew Computer 
								Club in Palo Alto, California.

							<p class="apple-computer-2__text text-size">
								The Apple II computer was first introduced in April 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire and became one 
								of the first and most successful personal computers of its time. Several models of the Apple II were produced, 
								and the most popular of them, with relatively minor changes, was sold until the 1990s. In total, 
								between 5 and 6 million Apple II units were produced.
							</p>
							<p class="apple-computer-2__text text-size">
								Unlike competitors, the appearance of the Apple II was designed so that it would look organic 
								on an office desk, and not as equipment for special computer rooms and data centers. 
								The computer also had unique capabilities for that time, including a color graphics mode, 
								albeit with certain limitations, and sound playback. Compared to earlier machines, 
								these capabilities were well documented and easy to learn. In doing so, the Apple II launched 
								a revolution in personal computing: it was a machine for ordinary people, not just for hobbyists, 
								scientists or engineers.

								in an ad during Super Bowl XVIII, on Jan. 22, 1984, and offered it for sale two days later.
							</p>
							<p class="macintosh__text text-size">
								The original Macintosh computer was designed to provide users with a natural, 
								intuitive and user-friendly computer interface. Advances in the Macintosh's user-friendly 
								design included the use of a mouse, icons to represent objects and actions, 
								the point-and-click and click-and-drag actions, and a number of window operation ideas. 
								Many of these GUI ideas came from experiments at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, 
								or PARC, in the early 1970s. Microsoft successfully adapted these concepts for its first 
								Windows operating system (OS).
